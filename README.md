ðŸ©¸ PHR Blood Donor Project
This project analyzes blood donor data to derive insights and predictions about blood donation patterns. It uses Python for data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

âœ… Project Workflow
Data Loading: Importing and exploring the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and preparing features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution of Recency, Frequency, and Time.

Correlation between features.

Model Building:

Implementing classification models to predict donor behavior.

Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Graphical representation of trends and predictions.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn


ðŸ“ˆ Results

Classification models were evaluated, and the best-performing model achieved high accuracy in predicting future donors.
Visualizations revealed clear patterns in donation frequency and recency affecting futureÂ donations.
